This QGIS plugin allows you to geocode UK postcodes offline. 

This means that it can extract longitude (eastings) and latitude (northings) from a postcode field.

It will work on any editable layer - but note, the layer needs to be in edit mode!

Not all data providers support "AddAttribute" - shapefile and PostGres layer do, GeoJSON and Delimited text don't, for example.

To keep the data size down, the postcode databases have been encoded into a compact binary format. The /utilities directory has tools to show you how to (re)generate the postcode databases.
