This QGIS plugin allows you to geocode UK postcodes offline. 

This means that it can extract longitude (eastings) and latitude (northings) from a postcode field.

It will work on any editable layer - but note, the layer needs to be in edit mode!

Not all data providers support "AddAttribute" - shapefile and PostGres layer do, GeoJSON and Delimited text don't, for example.

To keep the data size down, the postcode databases have been encoded into a compact binary format. 
The /utils directory has tools to show you how to (re)generate the postcode databases from the csv downloads.

There are two databases - the OS Open CodePoint and ONS postcode data. 

The OS version contains 1.6 Million postcodes, all of which are current. 

The ONS data set is larger - 2.5 Million - as it includes non-geographics postcodes and 'retired' postcodes.

OS Open CodePoint - Contains Ordnance Survey data, Crown Copyright and Database Rights 2015
ONS Postcode Database - Contains National Statistic data, Crown Copyright and Database right 2014
